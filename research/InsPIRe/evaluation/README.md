# Reproducing our Experimental Evaluation
The following document outlines the steps to reproduce all results from the paper accepted to IEEE S&P and the full version posted on [eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1352).

## Building the Project
Run `cargo build --release` to ensure correct build the project before proceeding.

For reproducing tables from the paper you will need to install the necessary python requirements.
```
    virtualenv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evaluating InsPIRe

To generate the evaluation data of InsPIRe in the paper, run the following:
```
run-inspire_0.sh
run-inspire-squared.sh # Full version only
run-inspire.sh
```

## InsPIRe for applications
To simulate the use of InsPIRe in applications, run the following:
```
run-application-experiments.sh
```
which produces the results in `results/application-experiments`.

Then, to visualize all results, run the following scripts:

## Visualizing Results

To summarize the results from all protocols in one table, run the following:
```
python visualize_all.py
```

To generate the protocol-specific tables, run the following:
```
python visualize_pir.py
python visualize_inspire_squared.py # Full version only
python visualize_inspire.py
```

## Benchmarking InspiRING

Run the following to generate the requires logs
```
cargo run --release --bin pack
```
then run the following to generate plots
```
python visualize_packing.py
```

## Related Work
The data for the related work can be generated by following the instructions below.

### YPIR

```
git clone https://github.com/menonsamir/ypir.git
cd ypir
cargo run --release -- 1073741824
cd ..
./run-ypir.sh
```

### Hintless PIR

```
git clone git@github.com:RasoulAM/hintless_pir-clone.git
cd hintless_pir-clone
sudo apt install bazel-bootstrap
sudo curl -L https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/latest/download/bazelisk-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/bazel
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazel
export USE_BAZEL_VERSION=7.1.2
bazel test //...
bazel build //hintless_simplepir:hintless_simplepir_benchmarks
cd ..
./run-hintlesspir.sh
```

To generate logs in the same format as the other schemes, update the text of the script then run it:
```
python parse_hintlesspir.py
```

### KSPIR

Clone the following repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:RasoulAM/kspir-clone.git
```
and build the project using the instructions in the repository.
Then run the following script to generate the logs:
```
./run-kspir.sh
```

To generate logs in the same format as the other schemes, update the text of the script then run it:
```
python parse_kspir.py
